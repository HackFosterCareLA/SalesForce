# Salesforce Foster Parent Recruiting and Onboarding Portal
This is an example of a Salesforce Community that can be used to optimize the experience for prospective and in-process Foster Parents 
resulting in an increased pipeline of candidate families and higher rentention rates during the onboarding process.

The live prototype is here: https://vlocityps10-153bf76670b-156eab4cda9.force.com/hackfostercare/s/

A high percentage of prospective Foster Parents drop out of the process for various reasons due to the current low-tech / low-touch 
approach that that relies on overworked case workers to manage the process manually via phone calls and paper forms. This process 
can be automated, and the application experience can be streamlined by engaging the prospective Foster Parents via an online portal. 
Frustration during the aquisition and onboarding of Foster Parents comes largely from a lack of understanding of the process and poor 
communication and responsiveness from the agencies.

This portal presumes the prospective Foster Parent has already been targeted via a digital marketing campaign tool (e.g. 
Salesforce Marketing Cloud). Once the Foster Parent lands here by clicking thru from the marketing email, they find a wealth of 
information and resources to help them on their journey through the process.

The portal provides several ways to address the current challenges. As you can see in the screenshot below, the tiles on the home page 
offer many topics that prospective Foster Parents can browse to get all the information they need. Articles and FAQs can be published 
here that address the common concerns. These articles are indexed so information is easy to find via Search as well.

If they don't find the information right away, rather than waiting on hold on the phone, they can ask the questions directly on the portal. 
A lot of information can be browsed anonymously, but you really want to get the parents to register and create an account where they can 
have access to a secure messaging capability to interact directly with case workers and Foster Parent intake specialists.

Discussion forums are also very useful where prospective parents can ask questions on various topics and see answers to questions 
from others.

Groups can also be created with other Foster Parents who have already been through the process and can inform and guide prospective 
parents from their own experiences.

Once the prospective parents have all the information they need and questions answered, there is clear explanantion of the process provided 
and the site navigates the parents through the process. Iteration is required to keep the process from being daunting, but the 
experience is made easier as applicants can track their progress and communications are automated via email or SMS.

After the preliminary eligbility and qualification questions are answered, the parents can submit their initial application information 
directly from the portal.
